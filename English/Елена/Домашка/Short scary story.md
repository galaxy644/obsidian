Two years ago I was in Omsk, my hometown. That evening I decided to go for a walk along the riverbank. It was cold and wet, it had been raining all day. Unfortunately, it was a very busy day and it was already dark when I went out. As expected, there were very few people on the embankment.

I noticed a man approaching me while I had been thinking about the events of the day. The man was a head taller than me, broader in the shoulders, and gave off a strong odour of alcohol. Suddenly he recognised me and addressed me by name. Do you remember me?Â  man asked. You hired me ten years ago, and you had told me it would be better for me. That year ten years ago I had to lay off over 50 people and I didn't remember all of them. I had been preparing for the worst case scenario, but to my surprise, the man started thanking me. If you hadn't fired me then, the man said, I would have worked as a plumber, I wouldn't have gone to school, I wouldn't have become an engineer.
