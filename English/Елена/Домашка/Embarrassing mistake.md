This embarrassing story happened many years ago, when I was just in the beginning of my career. That year I went to work for a large company as a technical director and my first daughter was born. You have no idea how busy my mind was. In those years, I was attractive enough and, as it turned out, one of my colleagues began to show me signs of interest in me. This was noticed by everyone in the team, with the exception of myself. The New Year holidays were approaching and my colleague had a plan to tell her confused co-worker how she felt. She ordered a beautiful box of good wine and enclosed a card with a touching declaration of love and a suggestion to drink the bottle in a romantic atmosphere. I should mention that I didn't drink any alcohol at all and never took any of the gift bottles home with me. That's why I presented the gift to the CFO of the company without a moment's hesitation and without even opening the package. The next day she came into my office and said she didn't mind, which really surprised me, so I smiled stupidly and went about my production duties. It's also important for the story that, unlike my colleagues, I never go to company events. Guess who wore the most beautiful dresses at the New Year's Eve party. It was only many years later that I realised why my relationship with both my CFO and my travel manager had soured after that New Year's.
